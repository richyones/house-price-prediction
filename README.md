## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between several housing characteristics and their impact on house prices. We aim to develop a regression model that can predict house prices in Ames, Iowa, based on features such as lot area, overall quality, indoor square footage, and kitchen quality.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Ames Housing Dataset**, which provides detailed information on over 1,400 houses. Key variables include:

- **SalePrice**: The price at which the house was sold (dependent variable)
- **LotArea**: Size of the lot (in square feet)
- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality of the house (ordinal scale)
- **OverallCond**: Overall condition of the house (ordinal scale)
- **InSF**: Total indoor square footage (calculated)
- **OutSF**: Total outdoor square footage (calculated)
- **KitchenQual**: Kitchen quality (ordinal scale)

## Research Question

**Objective**: To develop a model that accurately predicts house prices based on several independent variables, including lot area, overall quality, overall condition, indoor square footage, outdoor square footage, and kitchen quality.

**Hypothesis**: Fundamental housing characteristics, such as square footage and overall quality, are significant predictors of house price.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Selected relevant features and handled missing data.
   - Created new variables: `InSF` (indoor square footage) and `OutSF` (outdoor square footage).
   - Converted `KitchenQual` into a numeric scale for regression analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized the distribution of house prices and other variables.
   - Examined relationships between predictor variables and house prices using scatter plots and correlation analysis.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Built a multiple linear regression model with the following predictors: `LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `OverallCond`, `InSF`, `OutSF`, and `KQual`.
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as R-squared and F-statistics.

## Results

The model showed that several housing characteristics have a significant relationship with sale price, with the following key findings:

- **OverallQual** and **InSF** were the strongest predictors of house price, with correlation coefficients of 0.791 and 0.808, respectively.
- **LotArea** and **OutSF** had weaker but still significant correlations with house price.
- The regression model achieved an **R-squared value of 77.7%**, indicating that the model explains 77.7% of the variance in house prices.

### Key Plots and Correlations:

- **OverallQual vs. SalePrice**: Higher quality homes tend to have higher sale prices.
- **InSF vs. SalePrice**: Larger indoor spaces are associated with higher prices.
- **LotArea vs. SalePrice**: Larger lots contribute to higher sale prices, though the relationship is less pronounced.

## Usage

To run this analysis on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction-ames.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction-ames
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (using R or Python, depending on your setup):
   ```bash
   # For R
   install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'psych', 'ggpubr', 'car'))

   # For Python (if converting to Python)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the analysis script or Jupyter notebook to replicate the results.

## Conclusions

- **Significant Predictors**: Overall quality and indoor square footage are the most influential factors in predicting house prices in Ames, Iowa.
- **Model Performance**: The linear regression model explains 77.7% of the variance in house prices, making it a useful tool for house price prediction in this market.
- **Business Implications**: Real estate companies and individual buyers can use the model to estimate fair prices for houses based on core characteristics, helping them make informed decisions.

## Limitations

1. **Ames-Specific Data**: The dataset only covers houses in Ames, Iowa, so generalizing the results to other housing markets may be inappropriate.
2. **Subjectivity in Variables**: Variables like **OverallQual** and **KitchenQual** are subjective and may not be consistently applied across datasets or assessors.
3. **Unexplained Variation**: The model leaves about 22% of the variance in house prices unexplained, which may be due to external factors not included in the dataset.

## Future Work

- Expand the dataset to include houses from other markets to test the generalizability of the model.
- Include economic and financial variables (e.g., average time on the market, mortgage rates) to further improve the modelâ€™s predictive power.
- Investigate more advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) to potentially increase prediction accuracy.
